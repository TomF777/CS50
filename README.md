This is CS50 (aka CS50x through edX), Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.

All code and programmes in this repo were developed by myself as a solutions for problem tasks during the CS50 course.

**CS50 library usage:**

To use examples with CS50 library, download latest version:
https://github.com/cs50/libcs50/releases

Locate _cs50.c_ and _cs50.h_ in the downloaded zip under the path: _libcs50-11.0.3/src/_

Copy the two files into the location of the *.c file which should be compiled and run.

Copy cs50.h to location path of the MinGW-w64 include:  _...InstallationFolder/MSYS64/ucrt64/include/_

Run commands:

1. compile:
   
    _gcc -o filename filename.c cs50.c_
   
    It creates _filename.exe_ file.

3. execute:
   
    _./filename.exe_
