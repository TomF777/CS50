According to the formula given by Spotify I would calculate in first run the audio aura as follows:
SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs;

This query will result as follows:
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| AVG(energy) | AVG(valence) | AVG(danceability) |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| 0.65906     | 0.484443     | 0.71646           |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+


In general I would characterize the Audio Aura calculated this way as moderate in energy and having quite high level of danceability. In total the 'valence' can be estimated as average.
This way of calculation may be not representative because it calculates avarge of all songs.
Better approach would be to consider median or mood (as the most frequent number â€” that is, the number that occurs the highest number of times -  quote from medium.com) for each song's trait.
I would also consider to estimate on songs from more than one year.
And finally weigts for song's traits could be introduced to better calculate the aura.
